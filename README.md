# minihex

A minimalist, single-file hexadecimal editor written in less than 100 lines of C with no dependencies (except the standard library). The program tries to be as simple as possible.
Other features might be added in the future.

## Usage

```
make
./minihex <file>
```

To get help with the commands, do not provide any filename.
